class InputProvider(ABC):
    """Abstract interface for raw keyboard and mouse simulation.

    Unlike :class:`Backend`, an ``InputProvider`` has **no knowledge
    of elements or the accessibility tree**.  It sends low-level OS
    input events at screen coordinates or to the focused window.

    Touchpoint uses an ``InputProvider`` as a **fallback** when a
    native accessibility action is unavailable (e.g. the toolkit
    doesn't expose a ``click`` action, or a text field lacks an
    ``EditableText`` interface).  The public API bridges the gap:
    it reads the element's position from :attr:`Element.position`,
    then calls the appropriate ``InputProvider`` method.

    Whether fallback is attempted is controlled by the user via
    ``tp.configure(fallback_input=True)`` (the default).

    All methods are **fire-and-forget**: they inject the event into
    the OS input queue and return.  There is no feedback on whether
    the target application actually processed it.  If the underlying
    tool is missing or the call fails, methods raise
    :class:`RuntimeError`.
