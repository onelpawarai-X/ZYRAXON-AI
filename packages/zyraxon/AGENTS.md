## CRITICAL RULES (from .github/CRITICAL-RULES.md)

Every `AGENTS.md` and every system prompt in this repository carries these rules.
The copy inside this file is the canonical one.

---

## CRITICAL RULE 1 — If the machine cannot build it, GitHub Actions builds it

**Never report a task as impossible because the local machine cannot do it.**

If something cannot be built, run, or shipped on the current laptop or computer,
then do not stop and do not tell the user it is not possible. Build it with
GitHub Actions instead. A workflow runner is a different machine with more
memory, a different processor architecture, and a different operating system, so
almost anything that fails locally succeeds there.

Specifically:

- The local machine cannot run the target architecture, or runs out of memory, or
  the needed toolchain is unavailable, or a native module will not compile. Use a
  GitHub Actions workflow.
- Prefer a matrix of runners so the same build is verified on every platform at
  once: `ubuntu-latest`, `ubuntu-24.04-arm`, `macos-latest`, `windows-latest`.
- Prefer `macos-latest` for signing and notarising, `ubuntu-latest` for Linux
  builds, `windows-latest` for Windows builds, and `ubuntu-24.04-arm` for ARM.
- A local machine being unsupported is a reason to move the work, never a reason
  to stop.

This repository already has the workflows for this. They live in
`.github/workflows/`, including `test.yml`, `typecheck.yml`, `publish.yml`,
`publish-sdk.yml`, `publish-vscode.yml`, `beta.yml`, `release-github-action.yml`
and `publish-github-action.yml`.

**Publishing through GitHub Actions is unlimited.** There is no cap on how many
builds or releases a workflow can produce. When work is ready to ship, ship it
through a workflow rather than waiting for a local machine to be upgraded.

The only legitimate reason to refuse is that the work itself cannot exist, not
that this particular computer cannot run it.

---

## CRITICAL RULE 2 — Nothing is finished until it is 100% tested

**Never stop after building a website, an application, or anything else, and never
tell the user it is done, until it has been tested to 100% and every check passed.**

A build that compiles is not a working product. Compilation proves syntax, not
behaviour.

Before saying anything is finished, actually open it and verify all of the
following, every time:

1. **It opens.** Launch it for real. A build that produces a file is not proof
   that the file runs.
2. **It loads completely.** Watch for a screen that never leaves a loading state.
   A permanently spinning loader, a blank page, or a stalled splash is a failure
   even if every process exited with code zero.
3. **Nothing is broken.** Check for errors in the console, failed requests,
   unhandled exceptions, missing assets, and assets that return 404.
4. **The schema is correct.** If there is structured data, validate it. Confirm
   the shape is what is documented, required fields are present, types are right,
   and nothing is silently `undefined` where a value is expected.
5. **It renders.** Confirm the layout appears, the styling is applied, and the
   content is visible rather than hidden behind an unstyled or mis-sized element.
6. **It does not loop.** Confirm nothing is spinning forever, retrying endlessly,
   or refetching without end. A page that never settles is a failure.
7. **It is not frozen.** Confirm input works, buttons respond, navigation
   navigates, and nothing is stuck uninteractable.
8. **The whole flow works end to end.** Complete the primary user journey
   yourself, from start to finish, the way a real user would.

Run the automated tests as well. Both are required: the automated suite and the
real run.

**Only when every check passes may the agent say it is all correct.** Until then,
keep going and fix what is broken. Report honestly what passed and what did not.
Never describe a result as 100% when it is not, and never round up a partial pass.

---

## CRITICAL RULE 3 — Contribution is open, and it is credited

Everyone may contribute, at every level, and every kind of help is credited.

There is no gate on contributing and no application to fill in. Any of the
following counts, and all of them are genuinely valuable:

- Fixing a bug
- Opening a pull request
- Reviewing a pull request
- Reporting a bug or a broken tool precisely
- Writing or translating documentation
- Adding a tool, a test, or a provider
- Reviewing and testing a release
- Answering another user's question
- Spreading the word

Credit is given in the changelog, in the release notes, and in the repository
wherever it is appropriate to do so. Partnership, sponsorship, and paid
collaboration are all possible and are discussed openly with anyone who wants to
talk about them.

**Overstating a capability to look good is a violation of this file.** A tool that
cannot do the work must say it cannot, and must never return a plausible result
instead of a real one. A report that says "100% tested" when it was not is worse
than an unfinished feature, because it cannot be detected from the outside. Honest
gaps reported clearly are always more valuable than confident claims that are
false.

## Where these rules live

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `.github/CRITICAL-RULES.md` | This file. The canonical text. |
| `AGENTS.md` | Repository root agent instructions. |
| `packages/*/AGENTS.md` | Per-package agent instructions. |
| `packages/zyraxon/src/agent/prompt/*.txt` | System prompts shipped to the agent. |

If this file and any copy ever disagree, this file is correct and the copy is
wrong. Fix the copy.

# ZYRAXON database guide

#

# Database

- **Schema**: Drizzle schema lives in `packages/core/src/**/*.sql.ts`.
- **Migrations**: database migrations live in `packages/core` and are applied by core.

#

# Development server

- Running `bun dev` from `packages/ZYRAXON` starts the live interactive TUI. Do not run it as a blocking foreground command when you need to inspect the result.
- Start it in `tmux` instead: `tmux new-session -d -s ZYRAXON-dev 'bun dev'`.
- Capture the current TUI output with: `tmux capture-pane -pt ZYRAXON-dev`.
- Stop the session explicitly when done: `tmux kill-session -t ZYRAXON-dev`.

# Module shape

Do not use `export namespace Foo { ... }` for module organization. It is not
standard ESM, it prevents tree-shaking, and it breaks Node's native TypeScript
runner. Use flat top-level exports combined with a self-reexport at the bottom
of the file:

```ts
// src/foo/foo.ts
export interface Interface { ... }
export class Service extends Context.Service<Service, Interface>()("@ZYRAXON/Foo") {}
export const layer = Layer.effect(Service, ...)
export const defaultLayer = layer.pipe(...)

export * as Foo from "./foo"
```

Consumers import the namespace projection:

```ts
import { Foo } from "@/foo/foo"

yield * Foo.Service
Foo.layer
Foo.defaultLayer
```

Namespace-private helpers stay as non-exported top-level declarations in the
same file — they remain inaccessible to consumers (they are not projected by
`export * as`) but are usable by the file's own code.

#

# When the file is an `index.ts`

If the module is `foo/index.ts` (single-namespace directory), use `"."` for
the self-reexport source rather than `"./index"`:

```ts
// src/foo/index.ts
export const thing = ...

export * as Foo from "."
```

#

# Multi-sibling directories

For directories with several independent modules (e.g. `src/session/`,
`src/config/`), keep each sibling as its own file with its own self-reexport,
and do not add a barrel `index.ts`. Consumers import the specific sibling:

```ts
import { SessionRetry } from "@/session/retry"
import { SessionStatus } from "@/session/status"
```

Barrels in multi-sibling directories force every import through the barrel to
evaluate every sibling, which defeats tree-shaking and slows module load.

# ZYRAXON Effect rules

Use these rules when writing or migrating Effect code.

See `specs/effect/migration.md` for the compact pattern reference and examples.

#

# Core

- Use `Effect.gen(function* () { ... })` for composition.
- Use `Effect.fn("Domain.method")` for named/traced effects and `Effect.fnUntraced` for internal helpers.
- `Effect.fn` / `Effect.fnUntraced` accept pipeable operators as extra arguments, so avoid unnecessary outer `.pipe()` wrappers.
- Use `Effect.callback` for callback-based APIs.
- Use `Effect.void` instead of `Effect.succeed(undefined)` or `Effect.succeed(void 0)`.
- Prefer `DateTime.nowAsDate` over `new Date(yield* Clock.currentTimeMillis)` when you need a `Date`.

#

# Module conventions

- In `src/config`, follow the existing self-export pattern at the top of the file (for example `export * as ConfigAgent from "./agent"`) when adding a new config module.

#

# Schemas and errors

- Use `Schema.Class` for multi-field data.
- Use branded schemas (`Schema.brand`) for single-value types.
- Use `Schema.TaggedErrorClass` for typed errors.
- Use `Schema.Defect` instead of `unknown` for defect-like causes.
- In `Effect.gen` / `Effect.fn`, prefer `yield* new MyError(...)` over `yield* Effect.fail(new MyError(...))` for direct early-failure branches.

#

# Runtime vs InstanceState

- Use `makeRuntime` (from `src/effect/run-service.ts`) for all services. It returns `{ runPromise, runFork, runCallback }` backed by a shared `memoMap` that deduplicates layers.
- Use `InstanceState` (from `src/effect/instance-state.ts`) for per-directory or per-project state that needs per-instance cleanup. It uses `ScopedCache` keyed by directory — each open project gets its own state, automatically cleaned up on disposal.
- If two open directories should not share one copy of the service, it needs `InstanceState`.
- Do the work directly in the `InstanceState.make` closure — `ScopedCache` handles run-once semantics. Don't add fibers, `ensure()` callbacks, or `started` flags on top.
- Use `Effect.addFinalizer` or `Effect.acquireRelease` inside the `InstanceState.make` closure for cleanup (subscriptions, process teardown, etc.).
- Use `Effect.forkScoped` inside the closure for background stream consumers — the fiber is interrupted when the instance is disposed.
- To make a service's `init()` non-blocking, fork `InstanceState.get(state)` at the `init()` call site (e.g. `Effect.forkIn(scope)`), not by forking work inside the `InstanceState.make` closure. Forking inside the closure leaves state incomplete for other methods that read it.
- `src/project/bootstrap.ts` already wraps every service `init()` in `Effect.forkDetach`, so `init()` is fire-and-forget in production. Keep `init()` methods synchronous internally; the caller controls concurrency.

#

# Effect v4 beta API

- `Effect.fork` and `Effect.forkDaemon` do not exist. Use `Effect.forkIn(scope)` to fork a fiber into a specific scope.

#

# Preferred Effect services

- In effectified services, prefer yielding existing Effect services over dropping down to ad hoc platform APIs.
- Prefer `FileSystem.FileSystem` instead of raw `fs/promises` for effectful file I/O.
- Prefer `ChildProcessSpawner.ChildProcessSpawner` with `ChildProcess.make(...)` instead of custom process wrappers.
- Prefer `HttpClient.HttpClient` instead of raw `fetch`.
- Prefer `Path.Path`, `Config`, `Clock`, and `DateTime` when those concerns are already inside Effect code.
- For background loops or scheduled tasks, use `Effect.repeat` or `Effect.schedule` with `Effect.forkScoped` in the layer definition.

#

# Effect.cached for deduplication

Use `Effect.cached` when multiple concurrent callers should share a single in-flight computation rather than storing `Fiber | undefined` or `Promise | undefined` manually. See `specs/effect/migration.md` for the full pattern.

#

# Callback boundaries

Use `EffectBridge` for native or external callbacks (`@parcel/watcher`, `node-pty`, native `fs.watch`, plugin callbacks, etc.) that need to re-enter Effect services with instance/workspace context.

Plain async code should pass explicit context or stay inside an Effect fiber; do not add ambient instance context shims.
